# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a minimal user interface for chatting with AI models, supporting both text-based and audio-based interactions. The interface should be built using a modern frontend framework (React, Vue, or Svelte) and should be clean, responsive, and easy to use while providing essential chat functionality with voice input/output capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send text messages to AI models, so that I can have written conversations and receive text responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types a message in the input field THEN the system SHALL display the message in the chat history
2. WHEN the user submits a message THEN the system SHALL send it to the AI model and display the response
3. WHEN the AI model responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat history with clear visual distinction from user messages
4. IF the message is empty THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and provide visual feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to record and send audio messages, so that I can communicate with AI models using voice input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the record button THEN the system SHALL start recording audio from the microphone
2. WHEN the user is recording THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating recording is active
3. WHEN the user stops recording THEN the system SHALL convert the audio to text and send it as a message
4. IF microphone access is denied THEN the system SHALL display an error message and disable audio features
5. WHEN audio is being processed THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to hear AI responses as audio, so that I can listen to responses instead of reading them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI response is received THEN the system SHALL provide an option to play the response as audio
2. WHEN the user clicks play audio THEN the system SHALL convert the text response to speech and play it
3. WHEN audio is playing THEN the system SHALL provide controls to pause/stop playback
4. IF text-to-speech is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully disable audio playback features

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and minimal interface built with modern web technologies, so that I can focus on the conversation without distractions and have a responsive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL display only essential elements: chat history, input field, and send/record buttons
2. WHEN messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL use clear typography and appropriate spacing for readability
3. WHEN the chat history grows THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest messages
4. WHEN the interface is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain usability across different screen sizes
5. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL use a modern frontend framework (React, Vue, or Svelte) for component-based architecture

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the conversation history, so that I can reference previous messages and maintain context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages are sent or received THEN the system SHALL store them in the chat history
2. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL display the conversation history in chronological order
3. WHEN the chat history is long THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling to navigate through messages
4. WHEN a new message arrives THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show it unless the user is viewing older messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want basic error handling, so that I can understand when something goes wrong and continue using the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL indicate the connection status
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry the failed action
4. IF audio features fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to text-only mode gracefully
